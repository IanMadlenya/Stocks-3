# Android Stocks App

An Android app that can be used to view stocks and shares information from a wide variety of different businesses. The user maintains their own stocks portfolio so they only see the latest figures and information for the tickers that they are interested in â€“ be it technology businesses such as Google or Microsoft, or perhaps just the popular financial indicator such as the FTSE or Dow Jones. The portfolio can be added to or removed from at the users convenience.
